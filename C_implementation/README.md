# C implementation of a Neural Network

## Installation of the GNU Scientific Library (GSL)

In these links there are steps you that you can follow in order to install those packages:

* https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/jild13/2016/07/11/hello/
* https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/usage.html#

However, I did an executable file called `setup_GSL`. This one downloads and install the packages in the default folders used by GCC. You can execute in this way:

```sh
cd Artificial-Neural-Network/C_implementation
source setup_GSL
```

You'll probably have to wait because this takes a few minutes to be done.
